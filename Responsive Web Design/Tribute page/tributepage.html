      <p> <!--CONTENT--> <span class="firstcharacter">N</span>orma Cecilia Tanega was born in Vallejo, California to Otilda (Ramirez) and Tomas Tanega. Her interests in music and the arts were honed from an early age: she started teaching classical piano lessons at the age of 9, directed her high school's art gallery in her senior year, and by the age of 16 began displaying her own paintings, reciting poetry and performing music recitals at her public library. Tanega was awarded a scholarship to Scripps College, and would go on to earn an MFA at Claremont Graduate School. Afterwards, Tanega decided to take a backpacking trip through Europe. Upon her return, she moved to Greenich Village in New York City where she was immeresed in folk music scene and political activism.</p>

      <p>Tanega's music career took her many interesting places, including a brief period playing songs for patients in mental health hospitals and working as a camp counselor in the Catskill Mountains. Once, when Tanega happened to be performing some of her songs at camp, a Brooklyn-based music producer spotted her. In 1966, Tanega would go on to release her first album on Bob Crewe's New Voice Records label. Her first single, <q>Walkin' My Cat Named Dog</q>, became an international hit. An unorthodox entertainer, Tanega's initial success still holds up today: with her low voice, cynical yet rousing style and complex lyrics, many of her songs diverge from the structure of typical pop and folk music. While Tanega would not receive much more commercial success, her impact is still felt today. </p>

      <p>Artists today (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiUctedlJOg" target="_blank">Thee Oh Sees</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmdHaubofXA" target="_blank">Dr. Hook</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWtk4Z0Aqvw">Yo La Tengo</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0XwJC6FbtA">They Might Be Giants</a>) continue to cover Tanega's music. Her work has even found a place in popular culture; you can catch her song <q>You're Dead</q> in the opening credits of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititiâ€™s delightful vampire mockumentary <em>What We Do In The Shadows</em>.</p>
